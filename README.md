# remembered_chimes

The final project for an experimental music course I took in college was to create an experimental piece and write an essay on it. I decided to write a Cagean piece that was randomly arranged using Python's random module. The program takes manually input data on a day's worth of Cornell Chimes concerts, and outputs a matrix of sheet music indexes and note lengths.
